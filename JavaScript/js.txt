JavaScript is a programming language that deals with the interactivity and behaviour of the websites.

JavaScript runs or executes the code inside the web browser which acts as a host.

JavaScript is case sensitive.

JavaScript can be used along with html with the help of script tag.

Internally JavaScript can be embedded with HTML as follows:
      <script>alert("Hello,World")</script>

Externally JavaScript can be embedded with HTML as follows:
      <script src="script.js"></script>

      where script.js is a another file containing JavaScript code.

JavaScript "script" tag can be placed either inside the head or body tag.
    When JavaScript placed inside head tag,at first JavaScript code gets executed and then the content of webpage will be dislayed.

    But when placed inside body tag,the content webpage will be dislayed first and then the JavaScript code gets executed.

JavaScript comments:
    //Single Line Comment
    /*Multi Line Comment
          Hello,Iam Learning JavaScript*/

JavaScript Datatypes:
    String Ex."Hello"
    Number Ex.1,2,3
    Boolean Ex.2>1 //True or False
    Array Ex.fruits=["apple","Mango","pear"]
    Null Ex.email="null" //null means value does not exist.

JavaScript Operators:
    Arithmetic Operators:
        +   => addition(when used for numbers) or concatenation(when    used for strings)
        -   => Subtraction
        *   => Multiplication
        /   => Division
        %   => Modulus/Remainder
        =   => Assignment Operator
    
    Comparison Operators:
        ==  => Equal to
        !=  => Not Equal to
        >   => Greater than
        <   => Lesser than
        >=  => Greater than or Equal to
        <=  => Lesser than or Equal to

JavaScript Variables:
    Variables are containers that are used to store values.
    variables are created or declared using keyword "var"Ex.

    Rules to follow:
        1.Variable names are case sensitive. ex. x and X are not same.
        2.You cannot begin a variable name with a number. ex.var 24cash
        3.JavaScript variable names must not have spaces between them. ex.fastCars is correct whereas fast Cars is a wrong declaration.
        4.JavaScript keywords cannot be used to name variables. ex.alert,prompt should not be used.
        5.Variable without a value is undefined.Also values can be changed once set.

JavaScript Conditional Statements:
    Test whether the condition is true or false.
    ex. if(condition){
            //this part is executed when condition is true.
        }
        else{
            //this part is executed when condition is false.
        }

JavaScript Functions:
      Functions are a block of code created to perform a task when it is invoked or called.
      Built in function - alert()
      ex. function function_name(parameter1,parameter2,.....){
        //code is written here
      }

JavaScript Events:
      Events are code that listen out for the things happening to the web browser and then responds.
          ex. when a button is clicked and then it responds for us.

Concatenation:
  Used to add strings or text together.
